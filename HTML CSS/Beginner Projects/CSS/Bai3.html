        It's an unfortunate reality that we don't teach people how to make money (beyond getting a 9 to 5 job) as part of our education system.
        The truth is there are a lot of different, legitimate ways to make money. That doesn't mean they are easy and that 
        you won't have to work hard to succeed, but it does mean that if you're willing to open 
        your mind a bit you don't have to be stuck in an office from 9 to 5 for the next fifty years o your life.
