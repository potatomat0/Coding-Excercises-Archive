            How can someone survive in the wild?
            If your plane crashes in the woods and you manage to survive, stay near the plane. You’re more likely to be rescued. The same applies to a car in the desert.

            Always keep a lighter in your car in case you need to start a fire or create smoke to draw attention to you.

            Whatever you do, don’t go explore the desert and try to find help. When you move around, that’s how you get dehydrated and die.

            Now, if you are on foot in foreign lands, and somehow got lost in the woods, a military survival instructor taught
            me that you should follow a body of water downhill. Water almost always leads to people.

            Radithor was a patent medicine that is a well-known example of radioactive quackery and specifically of excessively broad and pseudoscientific application of the principle of radiation hormesis. It consisted of triple distilled water containing at a minimum 1 microcurie (37 kBq) each of the radium 226 and 228 isotopes.
